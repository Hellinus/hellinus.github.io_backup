> I have already written the note on the Chinese translation version of this book, you can read it here: [“#033 故事——材质、结构、风格和银幕剧作的原理”](https://cyyanhan.com/posts/033-%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B-%E6%9D%90%E8%B4%A8-%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84-%E9%A3%8E%E6%A0%BC%E5%92%8C%E9%93%B6%E5%B9%95%E5%89%A7%E4%BD%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86/). The only reason why I reread the English version is my distrust of translation and my pursuit of the original meaning.

## 7 The Substance of Story
### THE PROTAGONIST
- Generally, the protagonist is a single character.
- For two or more characters to form a Plural-Protagonist, two conditions must be met:
    1. All individuals in the group share the same desire. 
    2. In the struggle to achieve this desire, they mutually suffer and benefit. If one has a success, all benefit. If one has a setback, all suffer. Within a Plural-Protagonist, motivation, action, and consequence are communal.
- A story may, on the other hand, be Multiprotagonist. Here, unlike the Plural-Protagonist, characters pursue separate and individual desires, suffering and benefiting independently.
- It’s even possible, in rare cases, to switch protagonists halfway through a story.

**A PROTAGONIST is a willful character.**
Quality of will is as important as quantity and the true strength of the protagonist’s will may hide behind a passive characterization.

**The PROTAGONIST has a conscious desire.**


**The PROTAGONIST may also have a self-contradictory unconscious desire.**

**The PROTAGONIST has the capacities to pursue the Object of Desire convincingly.**

**The PROTAGONIST must have at least a chance to attain his desire.**



**The PROTAGONIST has the will and capacity to pursue the object of his conscious and/or unconscious desire to the end of the line, to the human limit established by setting and genre.**


**A STORY must build to a final action beyond which the audience cannot imagine another.**

**The PROTAGONIST must be empathetic; he may or may not be sympathetic.**
