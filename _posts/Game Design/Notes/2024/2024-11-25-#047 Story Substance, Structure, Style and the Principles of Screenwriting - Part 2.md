The only reason why I reread the English version is my distrust of translation and my pursuit of the original meaning.

## 2 The Structure Spectrum
### THE TERMINOLOGY OF STORY DESIGN
> From an instant to eternity, from the intracranial to the intergalactic, the life story of each and every character offers encyclopedic possibilities. The mark of a master is to select only a few moments but give us a lifetime.

#### Structure
A film isn’t just moments of conflict or activity, personality or emotionality, witty talk or symbols. What the writer seeks are events, for an event contains all the above and more.

**STRUCTURE is a selection of events from the characters’ life stories that is composed into a strategic sequence to arouse specific emotions and to express a specific view of life.**

#### Event
“Event” means change.

**A STORY EVENT creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a VALUE.**

**STORY VALUES are the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive, from one moment to the next.**

**A Story Event creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a value and ACHIEVED THROUGH CONFLICT.**

#### Scene
**A SCENE is an action through conflict in more or less continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character’s life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance. Ideally, every scene is a STORY EVENT.**

If exposition is a scene’s sole justification, a disciplined writer will trash it and weave its information into the film elsewhere.

***No scene that doesn’t turn.***

1 Scene != 1 Location.

#### Beat
**A BEAT is an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene.**

> Taking a closer look at the “lovers break up” scene: As the alarm goes off. Chris teases Andy and he reacts in kind. As they dress, teasing turns to sarcasm and they throw insults back and forth. Now in the kitchen Chris threatens Andy with: “If I left you, baby, you’d be so miserable …” but he calls her bluff with “That’s a misery I’d love.” In the garage Chris, afraid she’s losing him, begs Andy to stay, but he laughs and ridicules her plea. Finally, in the speeding car, Chris doubles her fist and punches Andy. A fight, a squeal of brakes. Andy jumps out with a bloody nose, slams the door and shouts, “It’s over,” leaving her in shock.
>
> This scene is built around six beats, six distinctively different behaviors, six clear changes of action/reaction: teasing each other, followed by a give-and-take of insults, then threatening and daring each other, next pleading and ridiculing, and finally exchanges of violence that lead to the last Beat and Turning Point: Andy’s decision and action that ends the relationship, and Chris’s dumbfounded surprise.

#### Sequence
Beats build scenes. Scenes then build the next largest movement of story design, the *Sequence*.

**A SEQUENCE is a series of scenes—generally two to five—that culminates with greater impact than any previous scene.**

#### Act
**An ACT is a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which causes a major reversal of values, more powerful in its impact than any previous sequence or scene.**

#### Story
A series of acts builds the largest structure of all: the *Story*.

- The arc of the film: the great sweep of change that takes life from one condition at the opening to a changed condition at the end.
- This final condition, this end change, must be *absolute* and *irreversible*.

**STORY CLIMAX: A story is a series of acts that build to a last act climax or story climax which brings about absolute and irreversible change.**

### THE STORY TRIANGLE
**To PLOT means to navigate through the dangerous terrain of story and when confronted by a dozen branching possibilities to choose the correct path. Plot is the writer’s choice of events and their design in time.**

#### Archplot, Miniplot, Antiplot
**CLASSICAL DESIGN means a story built around an active protagonist who struggles against primarily external forces of antagonism to pursue his or her desire, through continuous time, within a consistent and causally connected fictional reality, to a closed ending of absolute, irreversible change.**

- CLASSICAL DESIGN / Archplot
    - Causality
    - Closed Ending
    - Linear Time
    - External Conflict
    - Single Protagonist
    - Consistent Reality
    - Active Protagonist

- MINIMALISM / Miniplot
    - Open Ending
    - Internal Conflict
    - Multi-Protagonists
    - Passive Protagonist

- ANTI-STRUCTURE / Antiplot
    - Coincidence
    - Nonlinear Time
    - Inconsistent Realities

### FORMAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE STORY TRIANGLE
#### Closed Versus Open Endings
- The Archplot delivers a closed ending—all questions raised by the story are answered; all emotions evoked are satisfied.
- Miniplot, on the other hand, often leaves the ending somewhat open.

**A Story Climax of absolute, irreversible change that answers all questions raised by the telling and satisfies all audience emotion is a CLOSED ENDING.**

**A Story Climax that leaves a question or two unanswered and some emotion unfulfilled is an OPEN ENDING.**

#### External Versus Internal Conflict
- The Archplot puts emphasis on external conflict. Although characters often have strong inner conflicts, the emphasis falls on their struggles with personal relationships, with social institutions, or with forces in the physical world.
- In Miniplot, to the contrary, the protagonist may have strong external conflicts with family, society, and environment, but emphasis will fall on the battles within his own thoughts and feelings, conscious or unconscious.

#### Single Versus Multiple Protagonists
- The classically told story usually places a single protagonist—man, woman, or child—at the heart of the telling. One major story dominates screentime and its protagonist is the star role.
- However, if the writer splinters the film into a number of relatively small, subplot-sized stories, each with a separate protagonist, the result minimalizes the roller-coaster dynamic of the Archplot and creates the Multiplot variation of Miniplot that’s grown in popularity since the 1980s.

#### Active Versus Passive Protagonist
- The single protagonist of an Archplot tends to be active and dynamic, willfully pursuing desire through ever-escalating conflict and change.
- The protagonist of a Miniplot design, although not inert, is relatively reactive and passive.

**An ACTIVE PROTAGONIST, in the pursuit of desire, takes action in direct conflict with the people and the world around him.**

**A PASSIVE PROTAGONIST is outwardly inactive while pursuing desire inwardly, in conflict with aspects of his or her own nature.**

#### Linear Versus Nonlinear Time
- An Archplot begins at a certain point in time, moves elliptically through more or less continuous time, and ends at a later date.
- An antiplot, on the other hand, is often disjunctive, scrambling or fragmenting time to make it difficult, if not impossible, to sort what happened into any linear sequence.

**A story with or without flashbacks and arranged into a temporal order of events that the audience can follow is told in LINEAR TIME.**

**A story that either skips helter-skelter through time or so blurs temporal continuity that the audience cannot sort out what happens before and after what is told in NONLINEAR TIME.**

#### Causality Versus Coincidenc
- The Archplot stresses how things happen in the world, how a cause creates an effect, how this effect becomes a cause that triggers yet another effect.
- The Antiplot, on the other hand, often substitutes coincidence for causality, putting emphasis on the random collisions of things in the universe that break the chains of causality and **lead to fragmentation, meaninglessness, and absurdity.**

**CAUSALITY drives a story in which motivated actions cause effects that in turn become the causes of yet other effects, thereby interlinking the various levels of conflict in a chain reaction of episodes to the Story Climax, expressing the interconnectedness of reality.**

**COINCIDENCE drives a fictional world in which unmotivated actions trigger events that do not cause further effects, and therefore fragment the story into divergent episodes and an open ending, expressing the disconnectedness of existence.**

#### Consistent Versus Inconsistent Realities
**CONSISTENT REALITIES are fictional settings that establish modes of interaction between characters and their world that are kept consistently throughout the telling to create meaning.**

**INCONSISTENT REALITIES are settings that mix modes of interaction so that the story’s episodes jump inconsistently from one “reality” to another to create a sense of absurdity.**

#### Change Versus Stasis
- Change: Story arc.
- Stasis: The value-charged condition of the character’s life at the end of the film is virtually identical to that at the opening.

### THE POLITICS OF STORY DESIGN
- The Writer Must Earn His Living Writing.
- The Writer Must Master Classical Form.
- The Writer Must Believe in What He Writes.
