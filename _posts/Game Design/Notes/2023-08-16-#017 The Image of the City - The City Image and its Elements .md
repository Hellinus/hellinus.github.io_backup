Definition:
1. *Paths.*
    - Paths are the channels along which the observer customarily, occasionally, or potentially moves.
    - *streets, walkways, transit lines, canals, railroads...*
2. *Edges.*
    - Edges are the linear elements not used or considered as paths by the observer.
    - *Boundaries between two phases, linear breaks in continuity: shores, railroad cuts, edges of development, walls...*
    - Important organizing features, particularly in the role of holding together generalized areas.
3. *Districts.*
    - Districts are the medium-to-large sections of the city, conceived of as having tow-dimensional extent, which the observer mentally enters "inside of," and which are recognizable as having some common, identifying character.
    - Always identifiable from the inside, they are also used for exterior reference if visible from the outside.
4. *Nodes.*
    - Nodes are points, the strategic spots in a city into which an observer can enter, and which are the intersive foci to and from which he is traveling.
    - *Primarily junctions, places of a break in transportation, a crossing or convergence of paths, moments of shift from one structure to another...*
    - *Or the node may be simply concentrations, which gain their importance from being the condensation of some use or physical character, as a street-corner hangout or an enclosed square.*
    - Some are the focus and epitome of a district, over which their influence radiates and of which they stand as a symbol. Many partake of the nature of both juntions and concentrations.
5. *Landmarks.*
    - Landmarks are another type of point-reference, but in this case the observer does not enter within them, they are external.
    - *Usually a rather simply defined physical object: building, sign, store, mountain...*

    1. Some are distant ones, over the tops of smaller elements, and used as radial references.
        - They are within the city or at such a distance that for all practical purposes they symbolize a constant direction.
        - *Isolated towers, golden domes, great hills, sun...*
    2. Other are primarily local, being visible only in restricted localities and from certain approaches.
        - *innumerable signs, store fronts, trees, doorknobs, other urban derail...*
        - They are frequently used clues of identity and even of structure, and seem to be increasingly relied upon as a journey becomes more and more familiar. 

The image of a given physical reality may occasionally shift its type with different circumstances of viewing.

None of the element types isolated above exist in isolation in the real case.

## Paths
For most people, paths were the predominant city elements, although their importance varied according to the degree of familiarity with the city.

Particular paths may become important features in a number of ways.


## Edges

## Districts

## Nodes

## Landmarks

## Element Interrelations
