### Tool Features
- **Abundant Control Nodes:** Enable developers to manipulate object movement, lighting, special effects, camera behavior, and more with ease.
- **Flowchart:** Rapidly script level logic within flowcharts, allowing levels to respond dynamically to player actions.
- **Smooth Parameter Interpolation:** Offers Unity curves and DoTween integration to create seamless transition effects.
- **Various Node Templates:** Facilitate the quick creation of custom nodes for developers.
- **Real-time Reading and Saving:** Streamline development and debugging processes.

### General
The plugin is built upon Unity Visual Scripting, enhancing and refining nodes and logic to transform the original tool into a flowchart editing utility that aids in game level development. It allows developers to adjust the nodes, parameters, and connection sequences of the flowchart in real-time within the editor, thereby facilitating the game's real-time responses to player actions.

*Flow Example*

<!-- 插件以Uniny Visual Scripting为基础，添加完善了结点和逻辑，使原有工具成为了一个可用于辅助游戏关卡开发的流程图编辑工具，方便开发者能够在编辑器中实时调整流程图的结点、参数、连接顺序，并以此处理游戏对玩家的实时响应。 -->

### Inspiration
The plugin draws inspiration from the development pipeline of Polish developer CD Projekt Red, as well as the mission editing tools used in "Cyberpunk 2077."

<!-- 插件启发自波兰开发商CD Projekt Red的开发管线，以及《赛博朋克2077》的任务编辑工具。 -->

## MY CONTRIBUTIONS
### "Plugin Features and Framework Design"
The plugin employs a foundational architecture where functional nodes serve as base templates, upon which additional functional nodes are constructed. This architecture significantly reduces the workload associated with node programming. Moreover, when users require custom nodes, they can swiftly assemble them utilizing these functional templates.

<!-- 插件采用了以功能结点作为基础模板，在其之上构建功能结点的架构，通过这样的架构，减少了结点编程的工作量，同时在用户需要自定义结点的时候，也可以通过模板快速构建。 -->

### Coding & Iteration
This remains an ongoing project, anticipated to reach completion around April or May of 2025, at which point it will be launched on the Unity Asset Store. Until then, I will continue to test, iterate, and refine the user experience.

<!-- 这目前仍是一个进行中的项目，预计将在2025年4、5月左右完成开发，并登录Unity Asset Store。在这之前，我将持续测试、迭代，完善用户体验。 -->

## ACHIEVEMENT
