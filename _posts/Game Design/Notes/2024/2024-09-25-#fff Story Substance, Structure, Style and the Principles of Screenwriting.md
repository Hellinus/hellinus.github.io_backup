> I have already written the note on the Chinese translation version of this book, you can read it here: [“#033 故事——材质、结构、风格和银幕剧作的原理”](https://hellinus.com/posts/033-%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B-%E6%9D%90%E8%B4%A8-%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84-%E9%A3%8E%E6%A0%BC%E5%92%8C%E9%93%B6%E5%B9%95%E5%89%A7%E4%BD%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86/). The only reason why I reread the English version is my distrust of translation and my pursuit of the original meaning.

## Introduction
- Story is about principles, not rules.
- Story is about eternal, universal forms, not formulas.
- Story is about archetypes, not stereotypes.
    - The archetypal story unearths a universally human experience, then wraps itself inside a unique, culture-specific expression.
- Story is about thoroughness, not shortcuts.
- Story is about the realities, not the mysteries of writing.
