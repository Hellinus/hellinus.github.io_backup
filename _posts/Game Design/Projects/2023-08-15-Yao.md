### Story
The player portrays a journalist named Yu Hong, who suffers from depression and is dissatisfied with her job. While conducting fieldwork in a remote rural area, she unexpectedly encounters a case of suicide triggered by "rumors" involving a young girl. Driven by fame and the desire to increase her social media followers, Yu Hong chooses to continuously track and expose this incident. During her investigation, she meets a series of characters and gradually uncovers the truth behind the girl's suicide, which was fueled by rumors. As the investigation progresses, Yu Hong begins to awaken to the reality and wishes to use her influence to help the girl. However, she suddenly realizes that she too has been engulfed by the spreading rumors...

<!-- 玩家扮演一位患有抑郁症、工作不顺心的记者余虹，在偏远农村采风时，意外碰到因“谣言”而起的女孩自杀案。余虹为了名利、为了自己账号的粉丝数，选择不断追踪、爆料这件事。在调查报道中，她结识了一系列人物，逐渐了解了女孩被谣言吞噬，进而自杀的真相。随着调查，余虹逐渐醒悟，想用自己的力量帮助女孩，但突然发现自己也已被谣言团团包围…… -->

### Idea
The title *Yao* carries two layers of meaning in Chinese: the first layer refers to a lullaby for a daughter, while the second layer metaphorically alludes to "rumors." The story of the game revolves around "rumors," "superstition," and "the backwardness of old-fashioned feudal rural China," showcasing the tragedies of human stories in such a unique environment. We hope to tell a story through this game that immerses players while also prompting deep reflection afterwards.

<!-- “Yao”的标题在中文中有着两层含义，第一层是关于女儿的摇篮曲，第二层则隐喻着“谣言”。游戏的故事围绕着“谣言”、“迷信”和“中国旧时封建农村的落后”，展示了在这样特殊的环境下的人间故事的凄惨。我们希望通过这个游戏讲述出既能让人沉浸其中，又能在之后深刻反思的故事。 -->

### Inspiration
The inspiration for the game comes from numerous Chinese horror games, such as *[Firework](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1288310/Firework/)* and the *[Paper Bride](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286770/Paper_Bride_4_Bound_Love/)* series. Behind Chinese horror often lies reflection on reality.

<!-- 游戏的灵感来源于众多中式恐怖游戏，例如[《烟火》](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1288310/Firework/)、[《纸嫁衣》](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286770/Paper_Bride_4_Bound_Love/)系列等。中式恐怖的背后，往往蕴藏着对现实的反思。 -->

## MY CONTRIBUTIONS
### "Technical Director"
Since I'm the one who has the best knowledge of the game engine in our group, I'm "honored" to be the "technical director" of our group. During the production process, I am often the first one to conduct technical tests and define how to use certain parts of the engine.

At the same time I'm constantly coming up with all sorts of design conjectures related to the game and current technology as I test. Having a good grasp of the technology often helps inspire my designs.

<!-- 由于我是我们组中对游戏引擎掌握最好的人，所以我“荣幸”地成为了我们组的“技术总监”。在制作流程中，往往是由我首先进行技术测试，并规定如何使用引擎某一部分的功能。

同时我也在测试的过程中，不断地提出游戏和当前技术相关的种种设计猜想。对技术的掌握往往能帮助激发我的设计灵感。 -->

### Working with Programmers
As a designer with a degree in computer science, I was able to communicate well with the programmers. During the production, I was responsible for assigning tasks to the programmers and accepting these completed features, and I was also responsible for writing the PRDs (Product Requirement Document) for some features (e.g. cell phones).

This was the first time I've worked so closely with programmers (previous projects tended to be done by me alone), and I made some mistakes but also gained a lot from the experience.

<!-- 作为一个计算机专业出身的设计师，我和程序员们能够良好地沟通。在制作中，我负责给程序员们分配相应的任务并对这些完成的功能进行验收，一些功能（例如手机）的PRD也同样由我负责编写。

这是我第一次和程序员之间如此紧密的沟通合作（以前的项目往往是由我一人完成），我犯了一些错误但也从这次的经历中收获了许多。 -->

### Sound Design & Mixing
Just like my other projects, I was also responsible for the sound part of this game. In horror and thriller games, good sound effects often lead to more immersion. Despite the limited ten-day development cycle, I did my best to complete the sound effects and voice acting configuration. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time and energy to create a more perfect atmosphere, as is often the case with development.

<!-- 就像我的其他项目一样，我同样负责了这个游戏的音效部分。恐怖、惊悚类游戏中，好的音效往往能带来更多的沉浸感。尽管十几天的开发周期有限，但我仍然尽力完成了音效和配音的配置。很可惜没有足够的时间和精力去营造更完美的气氛，毕竟这也是开发一定会遇到的问题。 -->

## ACHIEVEMENT
This game was developed through team collaboration at the Seasun Seed Camp and was awarded the Best Narrative Prize at the 2023 Seasun Seed Camp. Approximately 7 to 8 teams participated, each with its own unique genre and characteristics.

<!-- 这款游戏是在西山居Seed训练营中团队合作开发的，获得了2023届西山居Seed训练营的最佳叙事奖。参与的团队大概有7~8队，每一个游戏的种类都不同但又都有着自己的特色。 -->

## MORE DOPE PICTURES...
![Start](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Start.png){: w="600"}
*Start Screen: The start button has been intentionally designed as the switch of a cassette player, and all elements here are closely related to the story.*
![Train](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Train.png){: w="600"}
*On The Bus: Here is the beginning of the game. We've used program animation to showcase the environment, introducing several gameplay elements related to mobile social media, and narrating part of the story background through a chat application format.*
![Village](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Village.png){: w="600"}
*Village Entrance: Please note that some characters on the banners use an old-fashioned writing style from a specific historical period. I proposed this idea and carefully selected specific characters to ensure the readability of the game.*
![School](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/School.png){: w="600"}
*Abandoned School: By narrating through the environment, we supplement the details of the game.*
![Tomb](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Tomb.png){: w="600"}
*Graveyard：This is one of the scenes I built, and the placement of each element has been carefully arranged in order to show the depth of the scene created by parallax scrolling.*
![Creepy](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Creepy.png){: w="600"}
*The Witch's House: A horror scene rich in Chinese flavor.*
![TikTok](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/TikTok.png){: w="600"}
*Mobile Social Media: An important interactive element of the game.*
![Comments](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Comments.png){: w="600"}
*Comments: When we were collecting in-game comments, we reached out to our friends in other groups, and their messages helped us a lot with the production.*
![Dead](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Dead.png){: w="600"}
*The Burial: The setting of the thundering sky sets up the tension of the current scene, a scene that is indeed about to have a climax.*
![Game1](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Game1.png){: w="600"}
*The gameplay of taking photos: As a content creator, players need to control the camera in their hands to capture the current subject.*
![Game2](/assets/img/GameDesign/Projects/Yao/Game2.png){: w="600"}
*Another Interaction Gameplay: Click on the tape strips to gradually fix the tape. The gameplay is relatively simple and mainly serves the plot. We did our best in just ten days of production time.*
