## What is plot?
Main events of a novel or story devised and presented by the writer as an **interrelated sequence**.

- What happened?
- Connection?

> Difference between story and plot:
> - story: king died and the queen died.
> - plot: king died and the queen died of her grief.

NO "AND THEN", USE **"THEREFORE"**
