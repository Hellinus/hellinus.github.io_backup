The only reason why I reread the English version is my distrust of translation and my pursuit of the original meaning.

## 2 The Structure Spectrum
### THE TERMINOLOGY OF STORY DESIGN
> From an instant to eternity, from the intracranial to the intergalactic, the life story of each and every character offers encyclopedic possibilities. The mark of a master is to select only a few moments but give us a lifetime.

#### Structure
A film isn’t just moments of conflict or activity, personality or emotionality, witty talk or symbols. What the writer seeks are events, for an event contains all the above and more.

**STRUCTURE is a selection of events from the characters’ life stories that is composed into a strategic sequence to arouse specific emotions and to express a specific view of life.**

#### Event
“Event” means change.

**A STORY EVENT creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a VALUE.**

**STORY VALUES are the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive, from one moment to the next.**

**A Story Event creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a value and ACHIEVED THROUGH CONFLICT.**

#### Scene
**A SCENE is an action through conflict in more or less continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character’s life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance. Ideally, every scene is a STORY EVENT.**

If exposition is a scene’s sole justification, a disciplined writer will trash it and weave its information into the film elsewhere.

***No scene that doesn’t turn.***

1 Scene != 1 Location.

#### Beat
**A BEAT is an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene.**

> Taking a closer look at the “lovers break up” scene: As the alarm goes off. Chris teases Andy and he reacts in kind. As they dress, teasing turns to sarcasm and they throw insults back and forth. Now in the kitchen Chris threatens Andy with: “If I left you, baby, you’d be so miserable …” but he calls her bluff with “That’s a misery I’d love.” In the garage Chris, afraid she’s losing him, begs Andy to stay, but he laughs and ridicules her plea. Finally, in the speeding car, Chris doubles her fist and punches Andy. A fight, a squeal of brakes. Andy jumps out with a bloody nose, slams the door and shouts, “It’s over,” leaving her in shock.
>
> This scene is built around six beats, six distinctively different behaviors, six clear changes of action/reaction: teasing each other, followed by a give-and-take of insults, then threatening and daring each other, next pleading and ridiculing, and finally exchanges of violence that lead to the last Beat and Turning Point: Andy’s decision and action that ends the relationship, and Chris’s dumbfounded surprise.

#### Sequence
Beats build scenes. Scenes then build the next largest movement of story design, the *Sequence*.

**A SEQUENCE is a series of scenes—generally two to five—that culminates with greater impact than any previous scene.**

#### Act
**An ACT is a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which causes a major reversal of values, more powerful in its impact than any previous sequence or scene.**

#### Story
A series of acts builds the largest structure of all: the *Story*.

- The arc of the film: the great sweep of change that takes life from one condition at the opening to a changed condition at the end.
- This final condition, this end change, must be *absolute* and *irreversible*.

**STORY CLIMAX: A story is a series of acts that build to a last act climax or story climax which brings about absolute and irreversible change.**

### THE STORY TRIANGLE





#### Archplot, Miniplot, Antiplot

### FORMAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE STORY TRIANGLE
#### Closed Versus Open Endings
#### External Versus Internal Conflict
#### Single Versus Multiple Protagonists
#### Active Versus Passive Protagonist
#### Linear Versus Nonlinear Time
#### Causality Versus Coincidenc
#### Consistent Versus Inconsistent Realities
#### Change Versus Stasis

### THE POLITICS OF STORY DESIGN
#### The Writer Must Earn His Living Writing
#### The Writer Must Master Classical Form
#### The Writer Must Believe in What He Writes
