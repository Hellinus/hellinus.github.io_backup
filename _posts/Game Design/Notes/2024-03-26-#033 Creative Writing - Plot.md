## What is plot?
Main events of a novel or story devised and presented by the writer as an **interrelated sequence**.

- What happened?
- Connection?

> Difference between story and plot:
> - story: king died and the queen died.
> - plot: king died and the queen died of her grief.

NO "AND THEN", USE **"THEREFORE"**

## Character + Action = Plot
### Character
#### WHAT DO THEY WANT?
> depict character's will, not the fate.
> need - fate; want - will

1st step to a story: a character that wanted something.

#### WHAT ARE THEIR WEAKNESSES?
Weaknesses are more interesting than their strengths.

#### WHERE ARE THEY FROM?
Both literal and emotional.

#### WHERE ARE THEY GOING?
From + Going = Character Arc

#### WHAT CAN YOUR CHARACTERS DO TO SURPRISE YOU?
Follow your character instead of leading.

### Action
Rising actions: Obstacls (other character or character's weakness).
