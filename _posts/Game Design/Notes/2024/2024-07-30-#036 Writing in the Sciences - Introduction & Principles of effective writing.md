## EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO
### Disclaimer
- Is this sentence easy to understand?
- Is this sentence enjoyable and interesting to read?
- Is this sentence readable?
- Is it written to inform or to obscure?

**Hallmark: spunky verbs become clunky nouns.**

## Themes
- Complex ideas don't require complex language.
- Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read!

## Overview: Principles of effective writing
1. **Cut** unnecessary words and phrases; learn to part with your words!
2. Use the **active** voice (subject + verb + object)
3. Write with verbs: use **strong verbs**, **avoid** turning **verbs into nouns**, and **don't bury the main verb**!

## Cut the clutter

> Example 1
>
> This paper **provides a review** of the **basic tenets** of cancer biology study design, using **as examples studies** that illustrate the **methodologic** challenges or that **demonstrate successful** solutions to the **difficulties** inherent **in biological research**.
> 
> This paper reviews cancer biology study design, using examples that illustrate specific challenges and solutions.

> Example 2
>
> **As it is well known**, increased athletic activity **has been related** to a **profile** of lower cardiovascular risk, lower blood pressure **levels**, and improved **muscular and cardio-respiratory performance**.
>
> Increased athletic activity is associated with lower cardiovascular risk, lower blood pressure, and improved fitness.

> Example 3
>
> The experimental **demonstration** is the **first of its kind** and is a proof of principle **for the concept** of laser driven particle acceleration in a structure loaded vacuum.
>
> The experiment provides the first proof of principle of laser-driven particle acceleration in a structure-loaded vacuum.

**Be vigilant and ruthless.**

### Common clutter:
1. Dead weight words and phrases
    - As it is well known

4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
    - Muscular and cardio-respiratory performance
    - Gilomagenesis
    - miR
5. Repetitive words or phrases
    - Studies/examples
    - Illustrate/demonstrate
    - Challenges/difficulties
    - Successful solutions
6. Adverbs
    - very, really, quite, basically, generally, etc.

### Long words and phrases that could be short:
