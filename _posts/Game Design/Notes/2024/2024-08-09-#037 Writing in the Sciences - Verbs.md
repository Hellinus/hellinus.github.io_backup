## Use the active voices
**"Subject-Verb-Object."**

- Passive voice: Object-Verb-Subject or Object-Verb
- Passive verb = a form of the verb "to be" + the past participle of the main verb (the main verb must be a transitive verb)

**transfert passive to active.**

> Is it really OK to use "We" and "I"?
>
> totally ok.

When is it OK to use the passive voice?
- **The methods section:**
    - What was done is more important than who did it!
    - Readers tend to skim the methods section for key words rather than reading it as prose.
    - May be more effort than it's worth to avoid using "we" and "I" in every sentence.

## Write with verbs
### Use strong verbs
1. Verbs make sentences go!
> "Loud music came from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena moved as the hungry corwd got to its feet."
>
> "Loud music **exploded** from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena **shook** as the hungry crowd **leaped** to its feet."

2. Pick the right verb!
> The WHO reports that approximately two-thirds of the world's diabetics are found in developing countries, and estimates that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.
>
> The WHO **estimates** that approximately two-thirds of the world's diabetics are found in developing countries, and **projects** that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.

3. Use "to be" verbs purposefully and sparingly.
    - is are was were be been am...

### Don't turn verbs into nouns
1. Don't kill verbs by turning them into nouns.

### Don't bury the main verb
1. Keep the subject and main verb (predicate) close together at the start of the sentence...
2. Readers are waiting for the verb!

## A few grammer tips
1. "Data are" not "Data is"...
2. Affect vs. effect
    - Affect is the **verb** "to influence"
    - Effect is the **noun form of this influence**
3. Compared to vs. compared with
    - Compare to = to point out similarities between **different things**
    - Compare with (used more often in science) = to point out differences between **similar things**
4. That vs. which
    - "That" is the restrictive (defining) pronoun
    - "Which" is the nonrestrictive (non-defining) pronoun
    - That: the **essential** clause cannot be eliminated without changing the meaning of the sentence.
    - Which: the **non-essential** clause can be eliminated without altering the basic meaning of the sentence (and **must be set off by commas**).
> The bike that is broken is in the garage. (Identifies which bike of many).
>
> The bike, which is broken, is in the garage. (Adds a fact about the only bike in question).

5. Singular antecedents
    - Do not use "they" or "their" when the subject is singular.
